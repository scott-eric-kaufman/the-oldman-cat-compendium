OLDMAN MUND: WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING

SEK: Getting in bed and taking a nap.

OLDMAN MUND: NOT IN HERE THIS IS MY BEDROOM

SEK: Yes in here, this is my bedroom.

OLDMAN MUND: IS NOT YOU SLEEP ON COUCH

SEK: Is too, and that's my bed.

OLDMAN MUND: IS NOT IS MY BED

SEK: Just because I haven't had the strength to walk back here for a week doesn't mean I've abdicated --

OLDMAN MUND: DOES TOO

SEK: I'm bigger than you.

OLDMAN MUND: SO WHAT

SEK: And I'm in pain.

OLDMAN MUND: DO YOU HAVE POINT OR JUST MAKING WORDS

SEK: I'm going to collapse into bed now --

OLDMAN MUND: NO YOU ARE NOT

SEK: And I'm officially abdicating responsibility for any collateral damages...
