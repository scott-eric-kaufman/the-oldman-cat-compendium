OLDMAN CAT: I AM SO CUTE CURLED UP IN YOUR HAT

SEK: You mean ON my hat.

OLDMAN CAT: I AM SO ADORABLE IN TUCKING MY PAWS IN YOUR HAT

SEK: As you crush it to death.

OLDMAN CAT: I AM SUCH A LITTLE KITTEN SNORING IN YOUR HAT

SEK: I thought those were the muffled screams of my poor crushed hat.

OLDMAN CAT: I AM DESERVING OF AFFECTION WITH MY TAIL TUCKED IN YOUR HAT

SEK: I was trying to think of ways that hat could smell worse, "cat butt" somehow never occurred to me.

OLDMAN CAT: KNOCK IT THE FUCK OFF I AM TRYING TO HAVE A MOMENT

SEK: OK, sorry, have your moment.

OLDMAN CAT: TOO LATE NOW IT IS ALL CAT BUTT FOR YOU

SEK: Get off my hat, nerd...
