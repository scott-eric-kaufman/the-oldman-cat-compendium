OLDMAN CAT: YOU PUSHED ME

SEK: I did not.

OLDMAN CAT: THEN WHAT HAPPENED

SEK: You fell off my lap.

OLDMAN CAT: BECAUSE YOU PUSHED ME

SEK: I did nothing of the sort.

OLDMAN CAT: STOP LAUGHING

SEK: I'm not laughing.

OLDMAN CAT: YOUR FACE IS FULL OF SMILES

SEK: Just happy you're not hurt.

OLDMAN CAT: I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED

SEK: To have fallen from such heights.

OLDMAN CAT: STOP LAUGHING WHAT IF I'M DEAD

SEK: You're not dead.

OLDMAN CAT: HOW DO YOU KNOW

OLDMAN CAT: I COULD BE HAUNTING YOU

OLDMAN CAT: I WILL FUCKING HAUNT YOU
