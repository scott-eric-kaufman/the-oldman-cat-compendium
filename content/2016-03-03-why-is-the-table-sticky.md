OLDMAN CAT: WHY IS THIS TABLE STICKY

SEK: Good question. Why IS this table sticky?

OLDMAN CAT: ASKED YOU FIRST

SEK: I'm not the one who made it sticky.

OLDMAN CAT: ME NEITHER ALL I DID WAS

SEK: All you did was what?

OLDMAN CAT: NOTHING

SEK: What did you do?

OLDMAN CAT: FINE I DRANK FROM YOUR WATER BOWL AFTER YOU FELL ASLEEP ON THE COUCH

SEK: My water bowl? You mean my coffee cup?

OLDMAN CAT: THE ONE THAT LOOKS JUST LIKE MY WATER BOWL

SEK: That's because they're the only damn cups I can find at the moment.

OLDMAN CAT: GOOD WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE

SEK: No, we're not. I don't always put water in my water bowl.

OLDMAN CAT: YOU ARE NOT KIDDING

SEK: Why would I kid about that?

OLDMAN CAT: THAT BILGE YOU HAD IN THERE LAST NIGHT PISSED ME OFF

SEK: It was warm ginger ale and vodka.

OLDMAN CAT: IT PISSED ME OFF

SEK: So let me guess, you stuck your paw in it, banged it around, made the splashy noise?

OLDMAN CAT: DAMN RIGHT I DID

SEK: And your original question was?
