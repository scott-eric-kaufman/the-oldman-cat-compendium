OLDMAN VIRGIL: YOUR PAIN WHERE DOES IT LIVE

SEK: Pretty much where they cut me open -- which would be where you are.

OLDMAN VIRGIL: I AM ON IT

SEK: I know.

OLDMAN VIRGIL: I MEAN I AM LITERALLY ON IT

SEK: I also meant that.

OLDMAN VIRGIL: I AM ON THE PLACE WHERE YOUR PAIN LIVES

SEK: I know the neighborhood, used to have an appendix there.

OLDMAN VIRGIL: I HAVE GOT THIS COVERED

SEK: I wish you didn't.

OLDMAN VIRGIL: I AM JOHNNY ON YOUR SPOT

SEK: It's really not necessary.

OLDMAN VIRGIL: YOU WOULD DO THE SAME FOR ME

SEK: I really wouldn't.

OLDMAN VIRGIL: I AM GLAD WE HAVE REACHED A CONSENSUS

SEK: I hate you.
