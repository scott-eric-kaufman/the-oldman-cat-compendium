THE YELLOW AVENGER: WHAT HAPPENED YOU WERE GONE

SEK: I had surgery, I didn't want to --

THE YELLOW AVENGER: SO I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO

SEK: I don't want to know, do I?

THE YELLOW AVENGER: IT IS MY SACRED DUTY

SEK: What is?

THE YELLOW AVENGER: TO PEE ON ALL THE THINGS

SEK: All of them?

THE YELLOW AVENGER: YOU WERE GONE

SEK: For 10 hours, if even.

THE YELLOW AVENGER: DESPERATE TIMES CALL FOR URINE EVERYWHERE

SEK: So you had no choice, you had to pee on that?

THE YELLOW AVENGER: I HAD NO CHOICE I HAD TO PEE ON THAT

SEK: And that?

THE YELLOW AVENGER: AND THAT

SEK: That as well?

THE YELLOW AVENGER: THAT AS WELL

SEK: So I should take "all the things" literally?

THE YELLOW AVENGER: YOU SHOULD TAKE ALL THE THINGS LITERALLY
