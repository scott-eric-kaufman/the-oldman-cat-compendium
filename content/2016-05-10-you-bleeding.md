OLDMAN VIRGIL: WAKE UP WAKE UP WAKE UP

SEK: What?

OLDMAN VIRGIL: WHY YOU BLEEDING

SEK: I'm sick and sleeping, not bleeding.

OLDMAN VIRGIL: YOU BLEEDING

SEK: No, I'm not -- wait, why am I bleeding?

OLDMAN VIRGIL: IT IS A MYSTERY

SEK: No, someone clawed the crap out of my arm.

OLDMAN VIRGIL: THE MYSTERY DEEP ENDS

SEK: No, it doesn't.

OLDMAN VIRGIL: IT DEEP ENDS DEEPER

SEK: It really doesn't.

OLDMAN VIRGIL: WE WILL NEVER KNOW WHY YOU BLEEDING

SEK: Pretty sure we will.

OLDMAN VIRGIL: PERHAPS THE DOORBELL RANG

SEK: And someone freaked the fuck out?

OLDMAN VIRGIL: AND SOMEONE FREAKED THE FUCK OUT

SEK: And...

OLDMAN VIRGIL: AND THE MYSTERIOUS DEEP ENDS AGAIN...
