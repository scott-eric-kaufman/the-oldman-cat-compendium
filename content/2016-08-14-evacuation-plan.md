[NICE CHURCH LADY came to SEK's door and asked him if he had an evacuation plan "just in case," and SEK said he'd looked up some shelters. She told him about some closer, unlisted ones.]

SEK: Are they cat-friendly?

NICE CHURCH LADY: That depends -- how sweet are your cats?

OLDMAN MUND: THE GODDAMN WATER BOWL IS DIRTY AGAIN

OLDMAN VIRGIL: I AM LOST IN THE DINING ROOM SAVE ME

OLDMAN MUND: IT WAS CLEAN FIVE MINUTES AGO WHAT THE FUCK

OLDMAN VIRGIL: NOW I AM LOST IN THE KITCHEN SAVE ME

OLDMAN MUND: DON'T MAKE ME KNOCK THIS SHIT OVER I WILL DO IT

OLDMAN VIRGIL: I AM RIGHT NEXT TO NOW YOU SAVE ME I AM LOST

SEK: Adorable -- just adorable.
