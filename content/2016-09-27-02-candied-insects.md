1. I take a nice long bubble bath in an apartment empty but for me and the OLDMEN
2. I sleep for eight hours alone but for me and the OLDMEN
3. I awake to find half my house covered in tiny black insects carrying eggs that are neeither ants nor fleas nor anything else about which the Internet knows
4. This place is weird
5. And hopefully they disappear as quickly and magically as they appeared

...

1. The day after the debate, clips from this culturally insensitive animated film "Rio" is currently playing on Fox News. Just kidding -- actually, just kidding about "just kidding," it really is.
2. There were half as many invading insects early this morning and about a third of half by noon, so if my math's correct they should all have un-infested my house by day's end.
3. Like I said this place is weird.
4. On another note, "Luke Cage" won't be released until September 30th, I was wrong about that.
