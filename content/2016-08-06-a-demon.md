[SEK's neighbor is cleaning garbage cans outside with a power washer, presumably because of how stuff soured during recent, frequent power outages]

OLDMAN MUND: WHAT THAT

SEK: A demon.

OLDMAN MUND: WHAT A DEMON

SEK: Coming for you, apparently.

OLDMAN MUND: WHAT I DO

SEK: That's between you and your demon.

OLDMAN MUND: IT FEAR EARS

SEK: I don't think it fears ears.

OLDMAN MUND: IT FEAR HIDING

SEK: It's very afraid of hiding.

OLDMAN MUND: OK I HIDE

SEK: OK.

OLDMAN MUND: SHOUT WHEN IT SCARED AWAY

SEK: I'll do that.
