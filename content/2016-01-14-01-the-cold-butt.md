SEK: I give up, what is this?

OLDMAN CAT: THE COLD BUTT

SEK: And that would be?

OLDMAN CAT: LIKE THE COLD SHOULDER BUT WITH MY BUTT

SEK: And I am receiving this why?

OLDMAN CAT: INADEQUATE LAP FACILITIES

SEK: So you want me to have a bigger lap?

OLDMAN CAT: YES

SEK: But you're not trying to fatten me up for, say, a culling of some sort?

OLDMAN CAT: WHAT DOES ULTERIOR MOTIVE EVEN MEAN

SEK: Who said anything about motives, ulterior, posterior, or otherwise?

OLDMAN CAT: THIS IS THE COLD BUTT AND I AM GIVING IT TO YOU
