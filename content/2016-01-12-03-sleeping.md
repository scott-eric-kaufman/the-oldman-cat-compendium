OLDMAN CAT: <SNORE PURR SNORE PURR>

SEK: Well, look who's decided to be adora --

OLDMAN CAT: <WHAP WHAP WHAP>

SEK: WHY ARE YOU PUNCHING ME ON MY HEAD?

OLDMAN CAT: WHO I AM

SEK: You're you.

OLDMAN CAT: WHO YOU ARE

SEK: I'm me.

OLDMAN CAT: WHERE I AM WHAT I DOING

SEK: You were asleep on my shoulder until you attacked me.

OLDMAN CAT: WHY I SLEEP ON YOUR SHOULDER

SEK: Because I have a bad back and that's the most painful, inconvenient place you could sleep.

OLDMAN CAT: THAT SOUNDS LIKE ME

SEK: No shit.

OLDMAN CAT: WHY I ATTACK YOU

SEK: No clue.

OLDMAN CAT: WHAT YOU DO TO ME

SEK: Feed, shelter, care for...

OLDMAN CAT: FEED WHAT SHELTER WHERE CARE FOR HOW MUCH

SEK: This wouldn't be revenge for that trip to the vet's, would it?

OLDMAN CAT: I KNOW NOT OF WHAT YOU SPEAK

SEK: Why do I not believe --

OLDMAN CAT: <WHAP WHAP WHAP>

SEK: Seriously?

OLDMAN CAT: <PURR SNORE PURR SNORE>
