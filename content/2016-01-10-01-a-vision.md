OLDMAN CAT: I BELIEVE I HAD A VISION

SEK: I'm sure.

OLDMAN CAT: I WAS FROLICKING IN WARM SUNLIT FIELDS KISSED WITH DEW

SEK: I don't doubt it.

OLDMAN CAT: THERE WERE RAINBOWS AND SHIT

SEK: You close to getting to a point?

OLDMAN CAT: BUT THEN THIS ASSHOLE CAME AND STARTED SNORING IN IT

SEK: NyQuil only lasts so long, my friend.

OLDMAN CAT: HIS SNORES MURDERED THE RAINBOWS AND DARKENED THE SKIES AND KICKED ALL THE DEWS IN THEIR BALLS

SEK: I am going back to sleep now.

OLDMAN CAT: YOU ARE NOT YOU WILL LISTEN TO THE LAMENTATION SONG OF MY PEOPLE

SEK: Really?

OLDMAN CAT: THE EXTENDED VERSION WITH EXTRA TRACKS

SEK: Fine, I'm up.

OLDMAN CAT: OH LOOK A WARM SPOT THANK YOU
