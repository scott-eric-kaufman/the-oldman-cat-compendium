OLDMAN SIGMUND: YOU GOT A WATER BABY

OLDMAN VIRGIL: Shut up.

OLDMAN SIGMUND: ON YOUR BACK

OLDMAN VIRGIL: Leave me alone.

OLDMAN SIGMUND: AND I'M GONNA TOUCH IT

OLDMAN VIRGIL: DON'T YOU TOUCH IT

OLDMAN SIGMUND: HERE I GO I'M GONNA TOUCH IT

SEK: Leave your brother alone, Mund.

OLDMAN SIGMUND: WHY YOU KEEP TOUCHING IT

SEK: That's because it feels really weird.

OLDMAN SIGMUND: I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU REQUIRE INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION

SEK: Fine, but just once.

OLDMAN VIRGIL: I HATE YOU BOTH
